4. Generate your infrastructure diagram!

**Example prompt:**
```
Create a professional AWS cloud infrastructure architecture diagram 
showing VPC with 2 availability zones, public subnets with ALB and 
NAT gateways, private subnets with EKS cluster, database subnets 
with RDS PostgreSQL, and Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. Use AWS official 
colors and icons. Professional technical style.
```
