🚀 Just Deployed a Production-Grade AWS EKS Infrastructure with Full CI/CD Pipeline!

I'm excited to share my latest project: a complete end-to-end production infrastructure on AWS that demonstrates real-world DevOps practices.

🎯 What I Built:

Infrastructure (Terraform):
✅ AWS EKS cluster with auto-scaling node groups
✅ Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnets
✅ Bastion host for secure access
✅ KMS encryption for all sensitive data
✅ VPC Flow Logs and CloudWatch monitoring

CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins):
✅ Automated code quality analysis with SonarQube
✅ Container security scanning with Trivy
✅ Docker image building and pushing to ECR
✅ Zero-downtime deployments to Kubernetes
✅ Automated rollback capabilities

Application Stack:
✅ 3-tier architecture (React + Node.js + MySQL)
✅ Kubernetes deployments with HPA
✅ AWS Application Load Balancer for ingress
✅ Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (2-10 replicas)

Monitoring & Observability:
✅ Prometheus for metrics collection
✅ Grafana dashboards for visualization
✅ AlertManager for notifications
✅ Custom application metrics

💡 Key Learnings:

1. Infrastructure as Code - Terraform modules make infrastructure reusable and maintainable
2. Security First - Implemented multiple layers: KMS encryption, private subnets, security groups, IMDSv2
3. DevSecOps - Integrated security scanning at every stage of the pipeline
4. Automation - From code commit to production deployment in ~10 minutes
5. Observability - You can't improve what you can't measure

🛠️ Technologies Used:
AWS | EKS | Terraform | Jenkins | Docker | Kubernetes | Prometheus | Grafana | SonarQube | Trivy | React | Node.js | MySQL | Helm | GitOps

📊 Project Highlights:
• Pipeline Duration: 8-12 minutes from commit to production
• Security Scans: Code quality + Filesystem + Container image scanning
• High Availability: Multi-AZ deployment with auto-scaling
• Cost Optimized: ~$350/month for full production setup
• Zero Downtime: Rolling updates with health checks

🎓 What This Project Demonstrates:
✅ Production-ready infrastructure design
✅ CI/CD pipeline implementation
✅ Container orchestration at scale
✅ Security best practices
✅ Monitoring and observability
✅ Infrastructure automation
✅ Cloud cost optimization

🔗 Check it out:
The complete project with step-by-step documentation is available on GitHub. Perfect for anyone learning DevOps, preparing for interviews, or building production infrastructure.

💭 Reflections:
Building this project taught me that production infrastructure is not just about making things work—it's about making them work reliably, securely, and efficiently at scale. Every decision from subnet design to monitoring strategy impacts the final outcome.

Special thanks to the amazing DevOps community for the countless resources and best practices that guided this project!

🏗️ Building Production Infrastructure: Lessons from AWS EKS Deployment

After weeks of building, testing, and refining, I've completed a production-grade AWS EKS infrastructure project. Here's what I learned:

1. Infrastructure Design Matters

Started with a solid foundation:
• Multi-AZ VPC for high availability
• Private subnets for workloads (security)
• NAT Gateways for outbound traffic
• Bastion host for secure access

2. Security is Not Optional

Implemented defense in depth:
• KMS encryption for EKS, RDS, and Secrets
• IMDSv2 enforcement on EC2
• Security groups with least privilege
• Container image scanning with Trivy
• Code quality gates with SonarQube

3. Automation Saves Time (and Sanity)

Built a complete CI/CD pipeline:
• Automated testing and scanning
• Docker image building and pushing to ECR
• Kubernetes deployments with rollback capability
• All triggered by a simple git push

4. Observability is Critical

You can't manage what you can't see:
• Prometheus for metrics collection
• Grafana for visualization
• Custom dashboards for application metrics
• AlertManager for proactive notifications

5. Documentation is Part of the Product

Created comprehensive guides for:
• Infrastructure deployment
• CI/CD setup
• Application deployment
• Troubleshooting common issues

The Result:

A production-ready infrastructure that:
• Deploys in ~30 minutes (Terraform)
• Handles deployments in ~10 minutes (Jenkins)
• Auto-scales based on load
• Provides full observability
• Costs ~$350/month

Technologies: AWS EKS | Terraform | Jenkins | Docker | Kubernetes | Prometheus | Grafana | SonarQube | Trivy

Key Takeaway: Production infrastructure is 20% building and 80% making it reliable, secure, and maintainable.
